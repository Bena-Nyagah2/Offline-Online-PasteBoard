# Offline-Online-PasteBoard

Shared Text Rooms is a real-time collaborative messaging application that allows users to create rooms, share text messages, and communicate with others.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Communication:** WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Data Storage:** JSON file on the server, localStorage on the client

### Data Flow

- **Online Mode:** Real-time synchronization via WebSocket
- **Offline Mode:** Changes stored in localStorage, syncs when online
- **Local Network Mode:** Direct device communication

### Project Structure

```sh
shared-text-rooms/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js              # Main server file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rooms-data.json        # Server-side data storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # Project dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                # Client-side files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Main HTML file
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css     # Stylesheet
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js         # Client-side JavaScript
```

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/rooms:** Retrieve all rooms and their messages
- **WebSocket:** Real-time communication channel

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
**Problem:** The application shows "Offline" status even when the internet is available.
**Solution:**
- Check if the server is running
- Verify firewall settings
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Data Not Syncing
**Problem:** Changes made on one device are not appearing on others.
**Solution:**
- Ensure all devices are online
- Click "Refresh" to force sync
- Restart the server if needed

### Messages Not Saving
**Problem:** Messages disappear after saving or don‚Äôt appear at all.
**Solution:**
- Ensure messages are saved properly
- Check browser localStorage settings
- Clear cache and reload

## Security Considerations

- Messages stored in plain text
- No built-in encryption
- No authentication system in the current version
- Consider using HTTPS for security

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Login system, profiles, avatars
- **Enhanced Security:** End-to-end encryption, password-protected rooms
- **Rich Content:** File sharing, Markdown support
- **Notifications:** Push notifications, mentions
